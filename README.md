**Hello there.** :wave:

A little about me, I've got approximately *7 years of experience* in the IT field mostly doing helpdesk work.

I'm currently looking to expand my skillset and in either a Junior Sys Admin, or full Sys Admin role in the near future. 

I use GNU/Linux exclusively in both my daily life, and when I'm studying / coding.

I'm currently working with both *Python* and *BASH* as they are the two most prevalent languages in my environment. Most of my code for the time being is going to be very simplistic, hopefully evolving into more complex projects. At some point I'll also be diving into writing *Ansible* playbooks, as well as studying *Docker* and *Kubernetes*.

I'd like to also pursue a lower level language such as either *Rust* or *C*, due to them both being the Linux Kernel.

If you have any suggestions, tips, or constructive criticism, please feel free to reach out. I always appreciate learning more when I can.
